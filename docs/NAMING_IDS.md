# Naming option ids

The required format for `row.options[i].id`, why each rule exists, and what to do if your natural ids don't fit it.

Same rules as the [Python library](https://github.com/devanmolsharma/decidr) — the id format is part of the mechanism, not a style choice, so it's identical across both ports.

## The required format

Lowercase letters and digits, in segments joined by single underscores. No leading, trailing, or doubled underscores, no other punctuation, no spaces, no mixed case.

```ts
// good
{ id: "billing", description: "Charges, invoices, payment problems" }
{ id: "access_denied", description: "Login rejected due to permissions" }
{ id: "billing_refund", description: "Customer wants a refund" }

// rejected -- format
{ id: "Billing-Refund", description: "..." }      // uppercase, hyphen
{ id: "access__denied", description: "..." }       // doubled underscore
{ id: "_billing", description: "..." }             // leading underscore

// rejected -- too long
{ id: "the_customer_was_denied_access_due_to_an_expired_authentication_token", description: "..." }
```

This isn't just tidiness. Each underscore-separated segment is a real level of a hierarchy (`billing_refund` is level-1 `billing`, level-2 `refund`) — see [HIERARCHY.md](HIERARCHY.md) for how that's used to keep large option sets from all racing in one shot. A format the library can rely on structurally is what makes that possible without asking the caller to declare the hierarchy separately.

## Why length matters

Every option is walked to the end of its own id, one real token at a time (see [PREFIX_MATCHING.md](PREFIX_MATCHING.md)). A short id like `billing` usually resolves in one round. A long one can take several, bounded by `MAX_DEPTH` (6 rounds). Push past that bound and the option is marked `unscored` — not because it was wrong, but because resolving it would have taken more rounds than the library is willing to spend chasing one option.

`decidr` rejects any option id longer than 40 characters, at `decide()`-call time, before any request is sent:

```
DecisionError: option id "a_really_long_descriptive_slug_like_this_one" exceeds 40 characters
```

40 characters is generous relative to real option ids: every id in this project's own tests and examples is 14 characters or fewer (`access_denied`, `billing_refund`). It's meant to catch ids that were clearly never meant to be an *id* — a sentence, a description, a path — not to be a tight budget real category names bump against.

## Ids can't nest inside each other

`billing` and `billing_refund` can't both be options in the same `decide()` call. It's genuinely ambiguous which one is meant: is `billing` a standalone answer distinct from `billing_refund`, or is it the umbrella every `billing_*` option (including `billing_refund`) belongs under? `decidr` doesn't guess:

```
DecisionError: option id "billing" is a segment-prefix of "billing_refund" -- this makes the hierarchy ambiguous
```

If `billing` genuinely needs to be its own answer separate from more specific billing sub-categories, give it a more specific id too (`billing_general`) rather than leaving it as a bare prefix of the others.

## If your natural ids don't fit this shape

Rename the id, keep the full meaning in `description`. `Access Denied (expired token)` becomes `id: "access_expired"`, `description: "Login rejected because the authentication token had expired"`. The model reads the description either way — the id is what gets matched against, not what carries meaning.

## What the format check doesn't catch

There's no live check against the model's real tokenizer before running a decision, because there is no general way to get one — see [PREFIX_MATCHING.md](PREFIX_MATCHING.md) for what a tokenizer-free mechanism has to do instead. The 40-character cap and segment format are static, cheap, tokenizer-independent proxies for "this is likely to be expensive or ambiguous," not a guarantee either way. A 39-character id built entirely from rare subword fragments could still hit `MAX_DEPTH`; `unscored` and `MAX_DEPTH` are what actually resolve the question a live model has to answer.
